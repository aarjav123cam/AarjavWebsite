        <li><strong>ML solutions to Ricci Flow on real metrics:</strong> Using physics-informed neural networks to investigate metric solutions to the geometry problem of Ricci Flow: a curvature-based PDE on metrics which helped prove the famous Poincar√© conjecture. Created embeddings of the solutions, and subsequent visualisations. Accepted by a NeurIPS workshop in 2023 and the full paper can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05892">Arxiv</a>.   </li>
        <li><strong>Drift Detection in ML models:</strong> Investigating the issue of concept and data drift-an important issue to diagnose in production ML models. Trained a toy MNIST CNN model and simulated drift using various noise additions to calculate statistical deviations from which one can create automatic model retraining thresholds. This can help ensure an accurate production model.</li>
        <li><strong>Transformer Stock Price Prediction Model:</strong> Investigated the efficacy of transformer models for stock price prediction. By creating sequences of price data, created trading signals for various stock tickers, with mild success. </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Software Engineering</h4>

      <ul>  
        <li><strong>TODO Node.js web app School database system</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Full stack Skincare planner web app</strong> Java Spring Boot for backend and Typescript React for frontend. Created persistent database integration, as well as calendar sync.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect-4 minimax bot</strong> Created the ultimate Connect 4 champion bot. Used the minimax framework to look n-number of moves ahead to find the best move from a board position, within a given thinking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Full-stack task list project in Java and React:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Physics</h4>
      <ul>  

      <li><strong>Modelling n-body Orbit:</strong> Wrote a Python script to model n-body orbit using numerical integration, testing solution stability and sensitivity to initial conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>TODO NMR E1 Experiment</strong></li>
      </ul>
