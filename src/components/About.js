      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm a Theoretical Physics Masters graduate from the University of Cambridge, working in Software Engineering. In my current role at THG, I apply my skills in Python, Machine Learning, GCP, and Docker to solve complex problems in ML and ML Ops.</p>
      <p>Being a scientist at heart, I'm intrigued by the application of Mathematics and Machine Learning in real-world scenarios. I strive to bring this curiosity and rigorous analytical thinking to my work in tech. </p>
      <p>I'm always on the lookout for interesting problems and projects. Recently, I have become interested in finance and markets. I am also keen on building full-stack software projects to keep my skills sharp.</p>
      <p>Beyond work, you will often find me watching cricket (or dubiously playing), or out jogging.</p>
